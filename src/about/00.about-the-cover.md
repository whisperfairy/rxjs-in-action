The figure on the cover of RxJS in Action is captioned “Calmouck,” and shows a man equipped with a spear, a sword, and a bow and arrows. The illustration is taken from a collection of dress costumes from various countries by Jacques Grasset de Saint- Sauveur (1757-1810), titled Costumes de Différents Pays, published in France in 1797. Each illustration is finely drawn and colored by hand. The rich variety of Grasset de Saint-Sauveur’s collection reminds us vividly of how culturally apart the world’s towns and regions were just 200 years ago. Isolated from each other, people spoke different dialects and languages. In the streets or in the countryside, it was easy to identify where they lived and what their trade or station in life was just by their dress.

The way we dress has changed since then, and the diversity by region, so rich at the time, has faded away. It is now hard to tell apart the inhabitants of different conti- nents, let alone different towns, regions, or countries. Perhaps we have traded cultural diversity for a more varied personal life - certainly for a more varied and fast-paced technological life.

At a time when it is hard to tell one computer book from another, Manning cele- brates the inventiveness and initiative of the computer business with book covers based on the rich diversity of regional life of two centuries ago, brought back to life by Grasset de Saint-Sauveur’s pictures.
