当我们使用面向对象的方法来撰写代码的时候，我们常备教导要将需求拆解为组件、交互以及状态。这种拆分的方法运用在应用层面，甚至对于各个部分还会继续去拆分，直到设计出一系列实现了了一系列精心设计过的行为的可继承的类。由此我们可以看出，传统的面向对象设计将类作为应用的最主要单元。每当组件被创建，就会将相应的状态与其相关联，并通过结构化的方式操作状态来描述应用程序逻辑。以传统的在线网上银行系统举例，银行系统所包含的模块不仅存、取款以及转账还包括领域模型存储和管理其他相关属性，比如账户和用户信息。通过行为操作相关的状态并转化为预期的输出。换句话说，行为是被系统状态的变化所驱动的。如果通过传统的面向对象方法来设计系统，系统的主要单元就是账户、用户、钱这些对象所抽象成的类型。

但响应式编程的与之就有很大的不同，响应式编程设计基础单元是流（stream)。

这这个章节里，我们会指导如何使用流（响应式编程）的思想去设计代码，来代替传统的使用数据以及通过数据的不断改变知道数据变为与其状态的方法。你们将会学习如何处理不同类型的数据源，无论动态还是静态的数据源，RxJS 流提供了基于Observable数据类型的持续可操作的数据模型。然而 Rx 不像其他的 Javascript 类库，使用RxJS以为着你的程序将大量的使用新的API，你需要将应用程序拆解为一系列数据在生产者（producer）以及消费者（consumer）之间流动的流通过各种操作符实现了应用程序的需求，而不是通过类中的声明函数操作一系列对象状态。

这种编程的思维方式把时间放在了设计程序最重要的位置;这个概念是作为一个RxJS 流的组件设计的主线，让数据在 RxJS 的组件中持续流动，不会被存储。将这种方式与现实世界的物理水流相关联，可以将数据源视为流的顶部，将数据用作流的底部。因此，数据总是沿着一个单一的方向流向下游，就像河流中的水一样，可以通过控制水坝来改变这个水流的状态。以这种方式思考将帮助您了解数据如何在应用程序中移动。

这并不是说这种理解很容易实现，就像任何新的技能一样，它必须随着时间的推移并通过迭代应用来建立起这些概念。正如你在第一章的例子中看到的那样，运动中的数据和保存在变量中的数据的概念对于大多数人来说是困难的。在本书中，我们将为您提供必要的基础知识来降低这种学习曲线。为了构建正确的知识体系，本章节将为帮助您更好地理解流以及响应式编程而打下了基础。而响应式编程背后的许多基本原理来自函数式编程，所以我们从这里开始。

## 2.1 函数式编程:响应式编程的支柱

响应式编程 (RP) 在函数式编程 ( FP )的基础上建立的，目前大部分响应式编程的的宣传还只来自开发社区，但页业界已经认识到函数式编程提供了一种吸引人的方式来设计你的代码。因此有必要对FP原则有一个基本的了解。如果您在函数式编程方面的知识拥有坚实的基础，您可以自由跳过本节，但我们建议您一并阅读，因为这有助于您更好地理解RxJS背后的一些设计理念。

就像第一章一样，我们希望您快速浏览一下Reactive Extensions项目（http://reactivex.io）的主页。其中，您会发现以下定义：

*ReactiveX是来自Observer模式，迭代器模式和函数式编程的最佳想法的组合。*

你了解了第一章观察者模式的主要组成部分（生产者和消费者）。现在您将学习响应式编程的两个重要理论基础函数式编程和迭代器。下面是一个图（图2.1），更好地说明了这些编程范式之间的关系。
我们先来看看FP的基础知识。

### 2.1.1函数式编程

函数式编程是一种强调以函数为核心构建程序的一种编程范式。具有 声明式（declarative）、不可变（immutable）以及无副作用等特性。你是否对immutable这个词感到陌生，我非常理解。应用程序不去改变状态的概念稍微有些难以理解。但不用担心，本书提供了大量的篇幅介绍如何在变量中使用并处理不可变数据。（注函数式也是面向对象编程）传统的面向对象或过程式编程范式的应用程序代码都依赖于来回改变和传递变量来解决问题。那么如何才能使用函数式编程完成同样的目标呢？以时钟为例。当时钟从下午1点开始到下午2点，这无疑是在变化，但是从函数式的角度来看，我们认为，不应该一秒变化一个时钟状态，而是每秒钟返回新的时钟实例。从理论上讲，两者都会同时到达，最终都会给你一个单一的状态。（方便测试）

RxJS从FP中借鉴了许多原则，特别是链式函数调用，延迟计算以及使用抽象数据类型编排数据流的概念。本书提供了一些设计决策通过Observable数据类型驱动RxJS流编程的开发。在我们进入之前，我们将解释我们刚刚给出的FP定义的主要部分，并向您展示一个涉及数组的简单示例。

这里详细介绍下上文提到的函数式编程特性：

- 声明式（Declarative）—它利用JavaScript的高阶函数的特性来详细描述业务逻辑。后文中会提到，函数链（也称为管道）以一种更加语义化的方式描述数据转换步骤。大多数人将SQL语法看作是声明性代码的完美示例。
- 不可变性--一个不可变的程序（指的是任何不可变的函数，模块或整个程序。注：笔者指的是不用那么死板的去理解不可变性，正如redux-observable在react生态的应用，函数式编程的特性可以灵活的在代码架构中组合）是在创建数据或声明变量后永远不会改变或修改数据的程序。这是必须掌握根本的概念，特别是当你来自面向对象背景时，需要转变思考的方式。函数式程序将数据视为不可变的恒定值。熟悉String类型标准库的人会发现，没有一个操作会改变它们原有的字符串。相反，他们都返回新的字符串。在本书中，我们使用const关键字限定变量，以创建在块级作用域范围内不可变的变量。这并不能解决所有不可变性的问题，但是当您的数据和功能在全局内共享时，它将为您提供一点额外的支持。
- 无副作用 --函数是否有副作用取决于函数内是否影响到其作用域外的变量。一个函数的作用域由它的参数和在其中声明的所有局部变量组成。与之外的任何事情交互（如阅读文件，写入控制台，在HTML页面上呈现元素等等）都被认为是一种副作用，应该避免，或者至少是孤立的。在本书中，您将学习RxJS如何通过将有副作用的业务推送到订阅者来处理。
  一般而言，可变性和副作用使函数不可靠（容易出错）和不可预测（不好测试）。这个问题的关键在于，如果一个函数不经意地改变了一个对象的内容，在不改变原始状态的情况下能否保证其他函数不会被受到影响。OO解决方案是封装状态并保护它免受系统其他组件的直接访问。相反，FP通过消除状态来处理这种问题，所以你的函数能稳定地依靠它来运行。

For instance, figure 2.2 illustrates the dependency between the two functions doWork() and doMoreWork() through a shared state variable called data.

This coupling presents an issue because doMoreWork now relies on doWork to run first. Two issues may occur:

* The result of doMoreWork() depends entirely on the successful outcome of doWork() and on no other parts of the system changing this variable.

* Unit tests against this function can’t be done in isolation as they should be, so your test results are susceptible to the order in which the test cases are run (in chapter 9, we’ll explore testing in much more detail).

Figure 2.2 Function doWork() is temporarily coupled to doMoreWork() because of the dependency on shared state (side effect). Hence, doWork() must be called before doMoreWork() or the program will cease to work.

Shared variables, especially in the global scope, add to the cognitive load of reasoning about your code because these variables demand that you keep track of them as you trace through it. Another way you can think of global data is as a hidden parameter within all your functions. So the more global the state you have to maintain, the harder it is for you to maintain your code. The example in figure 2.2 is an obvious side effect, but they’re not always this clear. Consider this trivial function that returns the lowest value in a numerical array:

```
const lowest = arr => arr.sort().shift();
```

Although this code may seem harmless to you, it packs a terrible side effect. Can you spot it? This function actually changes the contents of the input array, as shown in the following snippet. So if you used the first element of the array somewhere else, that’s completely gone now:

```
let source = [3,1,9,8,3,7,4,6,5];
let result = lowest(source); //-> 1
console.log(source); //-> [3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] // The original array changed!
```

The original array changed!

Later on, we’ll talk about a functional library that provides a rich set of functions for working with arrays immutably, so that things like this don’t inadvertently creep up on you.

Matters get worse if you have concurrent asynchronous processes where data structures are shared and used in different components. Because latency is unpredictable, you’d need to either nest your function calls or use some other robust synchronization mechanism to ensure they execute and mutate this state in the right order; otherwise, you’ll experience random and hard-to-troubleshoot bugs.

Fortunately, JavaScript is single threaded, so you don’t need to worry about shared state running through different threads. But as JavaScript developers, we deal quite often with concurrent code when either working with web workers or making simultaneous HTTP calls. Consider the trivial yet frequent use case illustrated in figure 2.3, which involves asynchronous code mixed with synchronous code. This presents a tremendous challenge because the latter assumes that the functions executing before it have completed successfully, which might not necessarily be the case if there’s some latency.

Figure 2.3 Function doAsyncWork() is an example of a remote call that fetches data from the server. Suppose this call has a latency around one second, depending on network conditions. Immediately after, the next function runs doMoreWork(), expecting that a piece of shared data has already been initialized. Because of this latency, the shared data has not been initialized, and the execution of doMoreWork() is compromised.

In this scenario, doAsyncWork() fetches some data from the server, which never completes in a constant amount of time. So doMoreWork() fails to run properly because it reads data that hasn’t yet been initialized. Callbacks and Promises help you solve this problem, so that you don’t have to hardcode your own timeouts in order to anticipate latency. Dealing directly with time is a recipe for disaster because your code will be extremely brittle and hard to maintain and will cause to you to come in to work during a weekend when your application is experiencing slightly more traffic than usual. Working with data immutably, using FP, and the help of an asynchronous library like RxJS can make these timing issues disappear - immutable variables are protected against time. In chapters 4 and 6, we’ll cover timing and synchronization with observables, which offer a much superior solution to this problem.

Even though JavaScript isn’t a pure functional language, with a bit of discipline and the help of the proper libraries you can use it completely functionally. As you learn to use RxJS, we ask that you also begin to embrace a functional coding style; it’s something we believe strongly about and promote in all code samples in this book.

Aside from using const to safeguard the variable’s reference, JavaScript also has support for a versatile array data structure with methods such as map, reduce, filter, and others. These are known as higher-order or first-class functions, and they’re one of the most important functional qualities in the language, allowing you to express JavaScript programs in an idiomatic way. A higher-order function is defined as one that can accept as argument as well as return other functions; they’re used extensively with RxJS, as with any functional data type.

The following listing shows a simple program that takes an array of numbers, extracts the even numbers, computes their squares, and sums their total.

Listing 2.1 Processing collections with map, reduce, and filter

```
const isEven = num => num % 2 === 0;
const square = num => num * num;
const add = (a, b) => a + b;

const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

arr.filter(isEven).map(square).reduce(add);  //-> 220
```

In this example, because these operations are side effect–free, this program will always produce the same value (220), given the same input array.

> Where can I find this code?

> All the code for this book can be found in the RxJS in Action GitHub repository at https://github.com/RxJSInAction. There, you’ll find two subrepositories. Under rxjs-in-action, you’ll find a simple application that contains the code for all individual chapter listings for chapters 1 through 9. All samples are presented as runnable snippets of RxJS code that you can interact with. Also, under the banking-in-action repository, you’ll find our web application that showcases RxJS embedded into a React/Redux architecture. Some of the APIs that we interact with in the book don’t allow cross-origin resource sharing (CORS). The simplest way to get around this is to disable it at the browser level by installing an extension or add-on.

If you imagine for a second having to write this program using a non-functional or imperative approach, you’ll probably need to write a loop, a conditional statement, and a few variables to keep track of things. FP, on the other hand, raises the level of abstraction and encourages a style of declarative coding that clearly states the purpose of a program, describing what it does and not how it does it. Nowhere in this short program is the presence of a loop, if/else, or any imperative control flow mechanism.

One of the main themes in FP that you’ll use as well in RP is programming without loops. In listing 2.1, you took advantage of map, reduce, and filter to hide manual looping constructs - allowing you to implement looping logic through functions’ arguments. Moreover, these functions are also immutable, which means that new arrays are created at each step of the way, keeping the original intact.

> JavaScript’s Array object has a special place in functional programming because it behaves as an extremely powerful data type called a functor. In a simple sense, functors are containers that can wrap data and expose a mapping method that allows you to immutably apply transformations on this data, as shown by the Array.map() method. As you’ll see learn later on, RxJS streams follow this same functor-like design.

> Functional programming is a huge subject to cover. In this book, we’ll cover only enough of FP to help you to understand and be proficient with RxJS and RP. If you’d like more information about FP and FP topics, you can read about them in detail in Functional Programming in JavaScript (Manning, 2016) by Luis Atencio.

The code shown in listing 2.1, which works well with arrays, also translates to streams. Along the lines of the pseudo Stream data type that we discussed in chapter 1, look at how similarly arrays and streams work when processing some number sequence:

```
Stream([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
  .filter(isEven)
  .map(square)
  .reduce(add)
  .subscribe(console.log);  //-> 220
```

You can clearly see how Rx was inspired by FP. All we had to do was wrap the array into a stream and then subscribe to it to listen for the computed values that derive from the sequence of steps declared in the stream’s pipeline. This is the same as saying that streams are containers that you can use to lift data (events) into their context, so that you can apply sequences of operations on this data until reaching your desired outcome. Fortunately, you’re already familiar with this concept from working with arrays for many years. You can lift a value into an array and map any functions to it. Suppose you declare some simple functions on strings like toUpper, slice, and repeat:

```
['rxjs'].map(toUpper).map(slice(0, 2)).map(repeat(2)); //-> 'RXRX'
```

The ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus once said, “You can never step into the same river twice.” He formulated this statement as part of his doctrine on change and motion being central components of the universe - everything is constantly in motion. This epic realization is what RxJS streams are all about: as data continuously flows and moves through the stream, orchestrated through this is the data type you’re learning about called Stream. Despite being dynamic, Streams are immutable data types. Once a Stream is declared to wrap an array, listen for mouse clicks, or respond to an HTTP call, you can’t mutate it or add a new value to it afterward - you must do it at the time of declaration. Hence, you’re specifying the dynamic behavior of an object or value declaratively and immutably. We’ll revisit this topic a bit more in the next chapter.

Moreover, the business logic of this program is pure and takes advantage of side effect–free functions that are mapped onto the stream to transform the produced data into the desired outcome. The advantage of this is that all side effects are isolated and pushed onto the consumers (logging to the console, in this case). This separation of concerns is ideal and keeps your business logic clean and pure. Figure 2.4 shows the role that the producers and consumers play.

Figure 2.4 Events emitted by producers are pushed through a pipeline of side effect–free functions, which implement the business logic of your program. This data flows to all observers in charge of consuming and displaying it.

Another design principle of streams that’s borrowed from FP is lazy evaluation. Lazy evaluation means that code is never called until actually needed. In other words, functions won’t evaluate until their results are used as part of some other expression. In the following example, the idea is that a stream sits idle until a subscriber (a consumer) is attached to it; only then will it emit the values 1–10:

```
Stream([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
  .filter(isEven)
  .map(square)
  .reduce(add); // Nothing runs here because no subscriber is added.
```

When a subscriber begins listening, the stream will emit events downstream through the pipeline in a single, unidirectional flow from the producer to the consumer. This is beneficial if your functions have side effects because the pipeline runs in a single direction, helping to ensure an orderly execution of your function calls. This is another reason to avoid side effects at all costs, especially when you begin combining multiple streams, because things can revert into the tangled mess that you’re trying to get rid of in the first place. Lazy evaluation is a mandatory requirement for streams because they emit data infinitely to handle mouse movements, key presses, and other asynchronous messages. Otherwise, storing the entire sequence of mouse movements in memory could make your programs crash.

> Reactive Manifesto

> One of the key principles of a reactive system is the ability to stay afloat under varying workloads - known as elasticity. Obviously, this has many architectural and infrastructural implications that extend beyond the scope of this book, but a corollary to this is that the paradigm you use shouldn’t change whether you’re dealing with one, one hundred, or thousands of events. RxJS offers a single computing model to handle finite as well as infinite streams.

> The Reactive Manifesto (http://www.reactivemanifesto.org) was published by a working group that aims at identifying patterns for building reactive systems. It has no direct relation to the Rx libraries, but philosophically there are many points in common.

For instance, without lazy evaluation, code that uses infinite streams like this will cause the application to run out of memory and halt:

```
//1
Stream.range(1, Number.POSITIVE_INFINITY) // Reads infinitely many numbers in memory
  .take(100)
  .subscribe(console.log);
//2
Stream.fromEvent('mousemove') // Listens to all mouse moves the user is performing
  .map(e => [e.clientX, e.clientY])
  .subscribe(console.log);
```

In example 1, lazy evaluation makes the stream smart enough to understand that it will never need to actually run through all the positive numbers infinitely before taking the first 100. And even if the amount of numbers to store is big, streams won’t persistently hold onto data; instead, any data emitted is immediately broadcast to all subscribers at the moment it gets generated. In example 2, imagine if you needed to store in memory the coordinates of all mouse movements on the screen; this could potentially take up a huge amount of memory. Instead of holding onto this data, RxJS lets it flow freely and uses the iterator pattern to traverse any type of data source irrespective of how it’s created.

### The iterator pattern

A key design principle behind RxJS streams is to give you a familiar traversal mechanism, just as you have with arrays. Iterators are used to traverse containers of data in a structure-agnostic way or independent of the underlying data structure used to harness these elements, whether it’s an array, a tree, a map, or even a stream. In addition, this pattern is effective at decoupling the business logic applied at each element from the iteration itself. The goal is to provide a single protocol for accessing each element and moving on to the next, as shown in figure 2.5.

Figure 2.5 Iterators abstract the traversal mechanism, whether a for or a while loop, so that processing any type of data is done in the exact same way.

We’ll explain this pattern briefly now, and later on you’ll see how this applies to streams. The JavaScript ES6 (or ES2015) standard defines the iterator protocol, which allows you to define or customize the iteration behavior of any iterable object. The iterable objects you’re most familiar with are arrays and strings. ES6 added Map and Set. With RxJS, we’ll treat streams as iterable data types as well.

You can make any object iterable by manipulating its underlying iterator. We’ll be using some ES6-specific syntax to show this. Consider an iterator object that traverses an array of numbers and buffers a set amount of contiguous elements. Here, the business logic performed is the buffering itself, which can be useful to group elements together to form numerical sets of any dimension, like the ones illustrated in figure 2.6.

Now let’s see what the code would look like. The next listing shows the internal implementation of this custom iterator, which contains the buffer logic.

Figure 2.6 Using an iterator to display sets of numbers of size 2

Listing 2.2 Custom BufferIterator function

```
function BufferIterator(arr, bufferSize = 2) { // Assigns a default buffer size of 2
  this[Symbol.iterator] = function () { // Overrides the provided array’s iterator mechanism. Symbol.iterator represents the array’s iterator function.
    let nextIndex = 0;
    return {
      next: () => { // The next() function is part of the Iterator interface and marks the next element in the iteration.
        if (nextIndex >= arr.length) {
          return {done: true}; // Returns an object with a done = true property, which causes the iteration mechanism to stop
        } else {
          let buffer = new Array(bufferSize);
          for(let i = 0; i < bufferSize; i++) { // Creates a temporary buffer array to group contiguous elements
            buffer[i] = (arr[nextIndex++]);
          }
          return {value: buffer, done: false}; // Returns the buffered items and a status of done = false, which indicates to the iteration mechanism to continue
        }
      }
    }
  };
}
```

Any clients of this API need only interact with the next() function, as outlined in the class diagram in figure 2.7. The business logic is hidden from the caller, the for...of block, which is the main goal of the iterator pattern.

The next() function in listing 2.2 is used to customize the behavior of the iteration through for...of or any other looping mechanism. As you’ll see later on, RxJS observers also implement a similar interface to signal to the stream to continue emitting elements.

**DID ITERATORS THROW YOU FOR A LOOP?** The ES6 iterator/iterable protocols are powerful features of the language. RxJS development predates this protocol, so it doesn’t use it at its core, but in many ways the pattern is still applied. We don’t use iterators in this book; nevertheless, we recommend you learn about them. You can read more about this protocol here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Iteration_protocols#iterator.

Figure 2.7 A class diagram (UML) highlighting the components of the iterator pattern. The Iterator interface defines the next() function, which is implemented by any concrete iterator (BufferIterator). Users of this API need only interact with the interface, which is general and applies to any custom traversal mechanism.

Iterators allow you to easily take advantage of the JavaScript runtime to take care of the iteration on your behalf. Following, we show some examples of this using our simple numerical domain. Buffering is built into RxJS, and it’s really useful to gather up a sequence of events and make decisions about the nature of these events or apply additional logic. An example of this is when you need to invoke an expensive operation in response to a sequence of mouse events, like drag and drop. Instead of running expensive code at each mouse position, you buffer a specific number of them and emit a single response, taking all into account. Implementing this yourself would be tricky, because it would involve time management and keeping external state that tracks the frequency and speed with which the user moves the mouse; certainly, you’ll want to delegate this to libraries that understand how to manage all this for you. We’ll examine buffers in more detail in chapter 4. In RxJS, buffers aren’t implemented as in listing 2.2, but it serves to show you an example of how you can buffer data using iterators, which is how you think about these sorts of operations. Here’s our BufferIterator in action:

```
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
for(let i of new BufferIterator(arr, 2)) { // Buffers two elements at once
    console.log(i);
}
//-> [1, 2] [3, 4] [5, 6]
for(let i of new BufferIterator(arr, 3)) { // Buffers three elements at once. Notice how the iteration mechanism is completely separate from the buffering logic.
    console.log(i);
}
//-> [1, 2, 3] [4, 5, 6]
```

When you subscribe to a stream, you’ll be traversing through many other data sources such as mouse clicks and key presses in the exact same way. Theoretically speaking, because our pseudo Stream type is an iterable object, you could traverse a set of key press events as well with a conventional loop:

```
const stream = Stream(R, x, J, S)[Symbol.iterator](); // Creating a stream that wraps key presses for those four letters
for(let keyEvent of stream) { // Traversing a stream is semantically equivalent to subscribing to it (more on this later).
  console.log(event.keyCode);
}
//-> 82, 120, 74, 83
```

Streams in RxJS also respect the Iterator interface, and subscribers of this stream will listen for all the events contained inside it. As you saw previously, iterators are great at decoupling the iteration mechanism and data being iterated over from the business logic. When data defines the control flow of the program, this is known as data-driven code.
