## Installing the example projects

To help you better understand the text, we’ve made two code repositories available to download and run so as to better see RxJS in Action.
The primary repository we use throughout the text contains the runnable code samples.
URL: https://github.com/RxJSInAction/rxjs-in-action

```
Node
  git clone https://github.com/RxJSInAction/rxjs-in-action.git cd rxjs-in-action
  npm install
  npm start
  <Open browser to localhost:8080>
```

The second repository, which is used only for chapter 10, contains a standalone application that can be accessed and run via the following.
URL: https://github.com/RxJSInAction/banking-in-action

```
Node
  git clone https://github.com/RxJSInAction/banking-in-action.git cd banking-in-action
  npm install
  npm start
  <Open browser to localhost:8080>
```

You can also find all the installation instructions on the respective repositories.


## Installing RxJS

This book uses the latest release of RxJS. RxJS 5 is a complete overhaul/redesign of the previous RxJS 4 version. The main factor driving this project is a focus on performance and simplicity. Re-architected under the Lift architecture by Paul Taylor, RxJS 5 fea- tures a significant reduction in the use of function closures, thereby lessening its run- time footprint. RxJS 5 was simplified to allow easier debugging and stack trace reports.
Furthermore, the new Observable data type was redesigned to be more confor- mant to the upcoming ES-observable-spec slated for JavaScript ES7. Finally, there’s a focus on modularity so that users can now download and use only the parts of RxJS they need instead of having to install a single monolithic library.

  Version: 5.0.2
  Homepage: https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs
  Installation details follow.

```
Browser
  https://unpkg.com/rxjs/bundles/Rx.min.js
Node
  npm install rxjs
```

In ES6 environments, you can load the Rx library in the following ways:
import Rx from 'rxjs/Rx';
const Rx = require('rxjs/Rx');


## Installing Ramda.js

This utility library was designed specifically for functional programming, which facili- tates the creation of function pipelines. All of Ramda’s functions are immutable and side effect–free. In addition, all the functions have automatic currying, and their parameters are arranged to make it convenient for currying and composition. Ramda also contains property lenses, which are used in this book to read/write the properties of objects in an immutable manner.

  Version: 0.18.0

  Installation details follow.

```
Browser
  <script src="ramda.js"></script>
